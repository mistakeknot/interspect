# Interspect Approve

Promote `propose` entries to `exclude` in routing-overrides.json, with canary monitoring and git commit.

<approve_target> #$ARGUMENTS </approve_target>

## Locate Library

```bash
INTERSPECT_LIB=$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache -path '*/clavain/*/hooks/lib-interspect.sh' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[[ -z "$INTERSPECT_LIB" ]] && INTERSPECT_LIB=$(find ~/projects -path '*/os/clavain/hooks/lib-interspect.sh' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -z "$INTERSPECT_LIB" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Could not locate hooks/lib-interspect.sh" >&2
    exit 1
fi
source "$INTERSPECT_LIB"
_interspect_ensure_db
DB=$(_interspect_db_path)
```

## Read Pending Proposals

```bash
ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
FILEPATH="${FLUX_ROUTING_OVERRIDES_PATH:-.claude/routing-overrides.json}"
FULLPATH="${ROOT}/${FILEPATH}"

if [[ ! -f "$FULLPATH" ]]; then
    echo "No routing-overrides.json found. Run /interspect:propose to detect eligible patterns."
    # Stop here
fi

PROPOSALS=$(jq -c '[.overrides[] | select(.action == "propose")]' "$FULLPATH" 2>/dev/null || echo "[]")
PROPOSAL_COUNT=$(echo "$PROPOSALS" | jq 'length')
```

## No Argument: Batch Approve

If no argument was provided (`<approve_target>` is empty):

If `PROPOSAL_COUNT == 0`:
> "No pending proposals. Run `/interspect:propose` to detect eligible patterns."

If proposals exist, show a summary table:

```
Pending proposals (N):

| Agent | Reason | Created | Evidence |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
```

Build the table from `PROPOSALS` JSON:
```bash
echo "$PROPOSALS" | jq -r '.[] | "| \(.agent) | \(.reason // "—")[0:60] | \(.created // "—")[0:10] | \(.evidence_ids | length) events |"'
```

Then present via **AskUserQuestion** (multi-select):

```
Which proposals do you want to approve? (Select all that apply)

Options:
- "{agent_1} — {reason_1_truncated}" for each proposal
- "Show evidence" — View recent corrections before deciding
```

If "Show evidence" is selected, for each proposed agent:

```bash
local escaped
escaped=$(_interspect_sql_escape "$agent")
sqlite3 -separator '|' "$DB" "SELECT ts, override_reason, substr(context, 1, 200) FROM evidence WHERE source = '${escaped}' AND event = 'override' ORDER BY ts DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

Format as human-readable summaries, then re-present the multi-select.

For each selected agent, call:
```bash
_interspect_approve_override "$agent"
```

Report results:
```
Approved N agent(s):
- {agent_1}: commit {sha_1}
- {agent_2}: commit {sha_2}

Canary monitoring active for all approved overrides.
Run /interspect:status after 5-10 sessions to check impact.
```

## With Argument: Single Approve

If an argument was provided:

1. Extract agent name from `<approve_target>`. Validate format:
```bash
AGENT="<approve_target>"
if ! _interspect_validate_agent_name "$AGENT"; then
    echo "Invalid agent name: ${AGENT}. Expected format: fd-<name>"
    # Stop here
fi
```

2. Check for propose entry:
```bash
if ! echo "$PROPOSALS" | jq -e --arg agent "$AGENT" '.[] | select(.agent == $agent)' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Check if already excluded
    if jq -e --arg agent "$AGENT" '.overrides[] | select(.agent == $agent and .action == "exclude")' "$FULLPATH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "${AGENT} is already excluded. Nothing to approve."
    else
        echo "No proposal found for ${AGENT}. Run /interspect:propose first."
    fi
    # Stop here
fi
```

3. Show proposal details and confirm:

```bash
DETAIL=$(echo "$PROPOSALS" | jq --arg agent "$AGENT" '.[] | select(.agent == $agent)')
REASON=$(echo "$DETAIL" | jq -r '.reason // "No reason provided"')
CREATED=$(echo "$DETAIL" | jq -r '.created // "unknown"')
EV_COUNT=$(echo "$DETAIL" | jq '.evidence_ids | length')
```

Present via AskUserQuestion:
```
Approve routing override for {AGENT}?

Proposed: {CREATED}
Reason: {REASON}
Evidence: {EV_COUNT} events

Options:
- "Approve" (Recommended) — Exclude {AGENT} from flux-drive triage with canary monitoring
- "Show evidence" — View recent corrections before deciding
- "Cancel" — Leave as proposal
```

If "Show evidence": query evidence DB (same as batch flow above), show summaries, re-ask.

If "Approve":
```bash
_interspect_approve_override "$AGENT"
```

If "Cancel": do nothing.
