# Interspect Evidence

Show detailed evidence for a specific agent. If no agent specified, list all agents with counts.

<evidence_target> #$ARGUMENTS </evidence_target>

## Locate Library

```bash
INTERSPECT_LIB=$(find ~/.claude/plugins/cache -path '*/clavain/*/hooks/lib-interspect.sh' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[[ -z "$INTERSPECT_LIB" ]] && INTERSPECT_LIB=$(find ~/projects -path '*/os/clavain/hooks/lib-interspect.sh' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [[ -z "$INTERSPECT_LIB" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Could not locate hooks/lib-interspect.sh" >&2
    exit 1
fi
source "$INTERSPECT_LIB"
_interspect_ensure_db
DB=$(_interspect_db_path)
```

## No Agent Specified — List All

If no arguments, show an overview of all agents:

```bash
AGENTS=$(sqlite3 -separator ' | ' "$DB" "
    SELECT
        source,
        COUNT(*) as events,
        COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as sessions,
        COUNT(DISTINCT project) as projects,
        MAX(ts) as last_seen
    FROM evidence
    GROUP BY source
    ORDER BY events DESC;
")
```

Present as:

```
## Interspect Evidence Overview

| Agent | Events | Sessions | Projects | Last Seen |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
{agent rows}

Run `/interspect:evidence <agent-name>` for detailed view.
```

## Agent Specified — Detailed View

```bash
AGENT="$1"
E_AGENT="${AGENT//\'/\'\'}"
```

### Event Breakdown

```bash
EVENTS=$(sqlite3 -separator ' | ' "$DB" "
    SELECT event, COALESCE(override_reason, '-'), COUNT(*)
    FROM evidence
    WHERE source = '${E_AGENT}'
    GROUP BY event, override_reason
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
")
```

### Weekly Timeline (last 8 weeks)

```bash
TIMELINE=$(sqlite3 -separator ' | ' "$DB" "
    SELECT
        strftime('%Y-W%W', ts) as week,
        COUNT(*) as cnt
    FROM evidence
    WHERE source = '${E_AGENT}'
        AND ts > datetime('now', '-56 days')
    GROUP BY week
    ORDER BY week;
")
```

Render as text histogram:

```
Week       | Count | Histogram
2026-W06   |     3 | ███
2026-W07   |     7 | ███████
```

### Recent Events (last 10)

```bash
RECENT=$(sqlite3 -separator ' | ' "$DB" "
    SELECT ts, event, COALESCE(override_reason, '-'), substr(context, 1, 120)
    FROM evidence
    WHERE source = '${E_AGENT}'
    ORDER BY ts DESC
    LIMIT 10;
")
```

### Present

```
## Interspect Evidence: {agent}

### Event Breakdown
| Event | Reason | Count |
|-------|--------|-------|
{event rows}

### Weekly Timeline
{histogram}

### Recent Events
| Timestamp | Event | Reason | Context (truncated) |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------------------|
{recent rows}

### Pattern Status
{Apply counting rules from /interspect and report this agent's status:
Ready/Growing/Emerging with specific criteria met/unmet}
```

## Edge Cases

- **Unknown agent:** "No evidence found for '{agent}'. Available agents: {list from overview query}."
- **Empty database:** "No evidence collected yet. Run `/interspect:correction <agent> <description>` to start."
